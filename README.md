# ESP32-Vernier-Scale
This project provides a robust solution for interfacing an ESP32 microcontroller with a standard 24-bit Digital Vernier Scale. It transforms a standard measuring tool into a smart device capable of real-time data processing, visual feedback via an OLED display, and remote configuration through Bluetooth Serial.
